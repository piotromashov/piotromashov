🛡️ Before that I worked as a Security Software Engineer for three years.

🎯 I've been studying and working in the IT industry for the past 10 years, in which I've acquired knowledge and expertise in lots of technologies.
My main tasks were to build and support products for a diverse set of tech companies, from seeding stages startups to IPOs.
Since the industry has been growing I have had many roles and combinations of them.

👨‍💻 SysAdmin, DevOps, Full-stack Engineer, Tech Lead. I consider myself a jack of all trades and quick learner.

💞️ Currently I have a newfound passion about Web3, the future of the internet, so I'm taking time off and diving deep into the Ethereum ecosystem and community.

🎧 As a hobby, I develop different lightning systems using arduino, and I'm a Techno DJ/Producer, events producer.
